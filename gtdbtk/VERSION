0.1.6
- align step in classify_wf and de_novo_wf function has been fixed.
- improve summary file output.
- "align" function now supports the same custom trimming GTDB will be performing.
- returns closest reference genome to summary file (even if the ANI is less than 95%)
0.1.5
- bug fixing 
0.1.4
- "align" function now supports the same custom trimming GTDB will be performing.
- returns closest reference genome to summary file (even if the ANI is less than 95%)
0.1.3
- v0.1.3 resolves bug that would occur when a user genome has a FastANI >= 95% with reference genomes but not with the closest pplacer leaf node. 
0.1.2
- resolve bug that would occasionally cause genomes to not be correctly associated with a reference genome in the pplacer tree. FastANI was still identifying correct species assignments.
0.1.1
- config_template.py updated
- rooting of the tree is now fixed.
0.1.0
- GTDB-Tk is now using archived (.gz) fna files
- summary.tsv file is now the main output file.
- fastani.tsv file is now combined with summary.tsv.
- red_value.tsv file has been removed.
- Each Pplacer placement on a species branch is now verify by FastANI and the ANI is compared with all other species in the same genus to check Pplacer accuracy.
- New functionality: "trim_msa" allows to trim an untrimmed MSA (41155AA for bac120 and 32675AA for ar122) based on GTDB-Tk masks
