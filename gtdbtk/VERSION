1.2.0
- Bug fixes:
- (#241) Moved GTDB-Tk entry point to __main__.py instead of bin/gtdbtk to support execution in some HPC systems (gtdbtk will still be aliased on install).
- (#251) Allow parsing of FastANI v1.0 output files. However, a warning will be displayed to update FastANI.
- (#254) Fixed an issue where --scratch_dir would fail, and not clean-up the mmap file.
- Features:
- (#242) Added the decorate command allowing the de novo workflow to be run
- (#244) Added the infer_rank method which established the taxonomic ranks of internal nodes of user trees based on RED
- (#248) If the identify command is run on the same directory, genomes which were already processed will be skipped.
- (#248) Improved pplacer output with running the classify command.
1.1.1
- Minor bug fixes.
1.1.0
- Bug fixes:
- In rare cases pplacer would assign an empty taxonomy string which would raise an error.
- (#229) Genomes using windows line carriage (\r\n) would raise an error.
- (#227) CentOS machines would fail when using `~` in paths.
- The bac120 symlink was pointing to the archaeal tree when using the `root` command.
- Features:
- Updated the `gtdb_to_ncbi_majority_vote.py` script for translating taxonomy.
- (#195) Added the `--pplacer_cpus` argument to specify the number of pplacer threads when running `classify` and `classify_wf` (#195).
- (#198) The `--debug` flag of `align` outputs aligned markers to disk before trimming.
- (#225) An optional third column in the `--batchfile` will specify an override to which translation table should be used. Leave blank to automatically determine the translation table (default).
- (#131) Users can now specify genomes which have NCBI accessions, as long as they are not GTDB-Tk representatives (a warning will be raised).
- (#191) Added a new command `ani_rep` which calculates the ANI of input genomes to all GTDB representative genomes. This command uses [Mash](https://github.com/marbl/Mash) in a pre-filtering step. If pre-filtering is enabled (default) then `mash` will need to be on the system path. To disable pre-filtering use the `--no_mash` flag.
- (#230) Improved how markers are used in determining the correct domain, and gene selection for the alignment.

0.1.6
- align step in classify_wf and de_novo_wf function has been fixed.
- improve summary file output.
- "align" function now supports the same custom trimming GTDB will be performing.

0.1.5
- bug fixing
0.1.4
- "align" function now supports the same custom trimming GTDB will be performing.
- returns closest reference genome to summary file (even if the ANI is less than 95%)
0.1.3
- v0.1.3 resolves bug that would occur when a user genome has a FastANI >= 95% with reference genomes but not with the closest pplacer leaf node.
0.1.2
- resolve bug that would occasionally cause genomes to not be correctly associated with a reference genome in the pplacer tree. FastANI was still identifying correct species assignments.
0.1.1
- config_template.py updated
- rooting of the tree is now fixed.
0.1.0
- GTDB-Tk is now using archived (.gz) fna files
- summary.tsv file is now the main output file.
