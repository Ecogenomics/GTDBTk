Classify workflow
-----------------

For arguments and output files, see each of the individual steps:

* :ref:`commands/identify`
* :ref:`commands/align`
* :ref:`commands/classify`

The classify workflow consists of four steps: ``ani_screen``, ``identify``, ``align``, and ``classify``.

The ``ani_screen`` step compares user genomes against a `Mash <https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x>`_ database composed of all GTDB representative genomes,
then verify the best mash hits using `skani <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02018-3>`_. User genomes classified with FastANI are not run through the rest of the pipeline (``identify``, ``align``, ``classify``)
and are reported in the summary file.

The ``identify`` step calls genes using `Prodigal <http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/>`_,
and uses HMM models and the `HMMER <http://hmmer.org/>`_ package to identify the
120 bacterial and 53 archaeal marker genes used for phylogenetic inference
(`Parks et al., 2018 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148503>`_). Multiple
sequence alignments (MSA) are obtained by aligning marker genes to their respective HMM model.


The ``align`` step concatenates the aligned marker genes and filters the concatenated MSA to approximately 5,000 amino acids.


Finally, the ``classify`` step uses `pplacer <http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/>`_ to find the maximum-likelihood
placement of each genome in the GTDB-Tk reference tree. GTDB-Tk classifies each genome based on its placement in the reference tree,
its relative evolutionary divergence, and/or average nucleotide identity (ANI) to reference genomes.

Results can be impacted by a lack of marker genes or contamination. We have validated GTDB-Tk on genomes
estimated to be ≥50% complete with ≤10% contamination consistent with community standards for medium or
higher quality single-amplified and metagenome-assembled genomes (`Bowers et al., 2017 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28787424>`_).


The classify workflow can be run as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    gtdbtk classify_wf --genome_dir <my_genomes> --out_dir <output_dir>

This will process all genomes in the directory <my_genomes> using both bacterial and archaeal marker sets and place the results in <output_dir>. Genomes must be in FASTA format (gzip with the extension .gz is acceptable).
The location of genomes can also be specified using a batch file with the ``--batchfile`` flag. The batch file is a two column file indicating the location of each genome and the desired genome identifier
(i.e., a Newick compatible alphanumeric string). These fields must be separated by a tab.

The workflow supports several optional flags, including:

* ``min_perc_aa``: allows filtering of genomes below a specified percentage of amino acids in the MSA
* ``cpus``: maximum number of CPUs to use

The taxonomic classification of each bacterial and archaeal genome is contained in the
:ref:`[prefix].[domain].summary.tsv <files/summary.tsv>`  output files.

For other flags please consult the command line interface.
