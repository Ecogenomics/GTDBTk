GTDB-Tk is a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and
archaeal genomes based on the Genome Database Taxonomy `GTDB <https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/>`_.
It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled
genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also be applied to isolate
and single-cell genomes. The GTDB-Tk is open source and released under the
`GNU General Public License (Version 3) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_.

Notifications about GTDB-Tk releases will be available through the GTDB Bluesky account
`<https://bsky.app/profile/ace-gtdb.bsky.social>`_.

Please post questions and issues related to GTDB-Tk on the Issues section of the GitHub repository.
Questions related to the `GTDB <https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/>`_ should be sent to the
