summary.tsv
===========

Classifications provided by the GTDB-Tk are in the files \<prefix>.bac120.summary.tsv and \<prefix>.ar53.summary.tsv for bacterial and archaeal genomes, respectively. These are tab separated files with the following columns:

* user_genome: Unique identifier of query genome taken from the FASTA file of the genome.
* classification: GTDB taxonomy string inferred by the GTDB-Tk. An unassigned species (i.e., ``s__``) indicates that the query genome is either i) placed outside a named genus or ii) the ANI to the closest intra-genus reference genome with an AF >=0.65 is not within the species-specific ANI circumscription radius.
* closest_genome_reference: indicates the accession number of the reference genome (species) to which a user genome was assigned based on ANI and AF. ANI values are only calculated when a query genome is placed within a defined genus and are evaluated for all reference genomes in that genus.
* closest_genome_reference_radius: indicates the species-specific ANI circumscription radius of the reference genomes used to determine if a query genome should be classified to the same species as the reference.
* closest_genome_taxonomy: indicates the GTDB taxonomy of the above reference genome.
* closest_genome_ani: indicates the ANI between the query and above reference genome.
* closest_genome_af: indicates the alignment fraction (AF) between the query and above reference genome.
* closest_placement_reference: indicates the accession number of the reference genome when a genome is placed on a terminal branch. 
* closest_placement_taxonomy: indicates the GTDB taxonomy of the above reference genome.
* closest_placement_ani: indicates the ANI between the query and above reference genome.
* closest_placement_af: indicates the alignment fraction (AF) between the query and above reference genome.
* pplacer_taxonomy: indicates the pplacer taxonomy of the query genome.
* classification_method:	indicates the rule used to classify the genome. This field will be one of: i) ANI, indicating a species assignement was based solely on the calculated ANI and AF with a reference genome; ii) ANI/Placement, indicating a species assignment was made based on both ANI and the placement of the genome in the reference tree; iii) taxonomic classification fully defined by topology, indicating that the classification could be determine based solely on the genome's position in the reference tree; or iv) taxonomic novelty determined using RED, indicating that the relative evolutionary divergence (RED) and placement of the genome in the reference tree were used to determine the classification.
* note: provides additional information regarding the classification of the genome. Currently this field is only filled out when a species determination is made and indicates if the placement of the genome in the reference tree and closest reference according to ANI/AF are the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). 
* other_related_references: lists up to the 100 closest reference genomes based on ANI. ANI calculations are only performed between a query genome and reference genomes in the same genus.
* msa_percent: indicates the percentage of the MSA spanned by the genome (i.e. percentage of columns with an amino acid).
* red_value: indicates, when required, the relative evolutionary divergence (RED) for a query genome. RED is not calculated when a query genome can be classified based on ANI.
* warnings: indicates unusual characteristics of the query genome that may impact the taxonomic assignment.
